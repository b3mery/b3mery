- 👋 Hi, I’m Ben Emery 
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new technologies, languages etc. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, working my way through 100 days of code on Udemy.
- 👨‍💻 My Experience: 
    * I was introduced into programing at University, where I completed the fundamentals of Java. While I like Java and want to continue learning it other langues and technologies have taken priorities due to work requirements.
    * I learnt SQL through an online Udemy bootcamp, and use it heavily in my current and previous profsessions. 
    * Python: Started learning Python in December 2021. I use it heavily in my current role for developing ETLs. I also complete projects and tutorials that peek my interest. 
    * HTML, CSS: I have completed a Responsive Web Design Certificate with FreeCodeCamp.
- 🏢 Work Experience:
    * I started off as an Accountant, moved into a Systems Accountant role.
    * Then transitioned into a System Analyst/Application Support role.
    * Now I'm currently an ETL Developer working with SQL, Python and Airflow to develop ETL piplines to integrate multiple source systems to our new data platform.
